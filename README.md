SendTempWarn
============

Send a Warning Email from the Raspberry Pi if the Temperature exceeds a limit

Using a DS18B20 sensor I got from eBay, and the code gleaned from an Adafruit Tutorial I could successfully read the temperature on my Pi.  Not satisfied with leaving it there, I incorporated some code that I had adapted to use to send me regular pics from my Webcam so that I get an email alert if the temperature gets above or below a limit that I have set.

This is my first proper go at Python so use it with care and any comments welcome.

I hope I have credited people where appropriate, if I haven't please get in touch.

Thanks!
